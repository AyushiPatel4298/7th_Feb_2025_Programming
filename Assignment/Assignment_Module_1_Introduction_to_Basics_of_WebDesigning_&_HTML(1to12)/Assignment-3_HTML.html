    <h6>Know more about Diamond Beach!!!</h6>
    <pre>
        Diamond Beach in Nusa Penida (Bali, Indonesia)is a hidden beach that has certainly become one of the most iconic spots
        on the island. Itâ€™s known for its dramatic green-topped rock formations, beautiful white beach, turquoise water and, of
        course, its Instagram photo spots.
        Until very recently the beach itself was inaccessible and you could only admire it from on top of the limestone cliff.
        However, now they have carved stairs into the cliffside that make the beautiful beach accessible!
