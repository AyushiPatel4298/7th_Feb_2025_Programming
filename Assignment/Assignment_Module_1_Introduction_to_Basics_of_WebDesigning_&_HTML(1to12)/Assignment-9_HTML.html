    <h2 class="h2">Welcome to New York city</h2>
    <p class="p">
        New York, often called New York City (NYC), is the most populous city in the United States. It is at the southern 
    end of the U.S. state of New York. Over 8 million people currently live in the city, and over 22 million people live in the
    bigger New York metropolitan area. It is the financial capital of the U.S. because it is home to the nation's stock
    market, Wall Street, and the One World Trade Center.
    <br>
    New York City is on one of the world's largest natural harbors. It is made up of five boroughs, each of which is a
    county of the state of New York.The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were
    combined into one city in 1898.The city and its metropolitan area are an important place for legal immigration to
    the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city
    in the world. New York has more than 3.2 million people born outside the United States, the biggest foreign-born
    population of any city in the world as of 2016.</p>
