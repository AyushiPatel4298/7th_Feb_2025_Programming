 Assignment 2: Adding Backgrounds and Colors
  Objective: Practice using colors and background properties.
 Instructions:
 1. Create an HTML page with three sections (<div> elements) labeled “Introduction,”
 “Content,” and “Footer.”
 2. Apply CSS to:
 o Give each section a different background color (use HEX or RGB values).
 o Add padding and set a specific width for each section.
 o Use a gradient background for the “Introduction” section.
 o Set a light gray background color for the entire webpage.
